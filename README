This is the Open Reefs Repository

There are two main directories. 

'examples' has code examples that offer the basic functionality of the system.
This code is meant to test each component of your design to ensure that it is
working properly. 

'production' has code that has full functionality and is meant for production
systems. This code has been tested and works on the specific system it was 
designed for. It may function on other systems but be advised that it has not
been tested on any other system.

The 'dev' diretory is really for developers only. You are free to browse and
even download any of the code but in general you will find it useless.

If you have questions or comments about anything please do not hesitate to ask.
